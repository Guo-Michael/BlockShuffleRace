# BlockShuffleRace
Minecraft Plugin - Block Shuffle Race!!! (Multiple Players)

Block Shuffle Race is finally up! (I couldn't find this version of block shuffle, so I created it myself!)

There is no timer; each time a new game is started, a randomized list of blocks will be created (unbeknownst to any of the players) for each player to hunt down. The first player who collects all their blocks in order wins.

Start Command:
/blockshufflestart [number of blocks to search for] [player1] [player2] [player3] ...

Stop Command:
/blockshufflestop

Block List Reveal Command (Only Reveals to the Command Writer):
/blockshufflelist
